<p>I decided to replace the array system for queueing and dequeueing items on the fringe along with storing their parents because 
    I ran into issues with the parent array returning the wrong node. The issue came from the fact that in A* there is path checking and 
    fringe popping after a solution is found, which would potentially mess up the parent array and as a result mess up the indexes of the true best path. 
    Since nodes have multiple parents, I made it so a queue entry is stored as a collection of items: queueItemID, nodeID, parentQueueItemID, Distance, weightedDistance. 
    The priority queue is then an ArrayList of these entries This will eliminate the issue of the wrong nodes being returned in the shortest path because 
    the queueItems represent individual nodes in individual paths, not an individual node across all paths. QueueItem with an ID of 3 can have the same nodeID
    as QueueItem with an ID of 18 yet will have a different parent because itâ€™s part of a different path.
</p>
<p>After the entries are visited, they are popped off the queue and added to a UsedQueue ArrayList.
     This is used to find the nodes within the shortest path at the end of the function, working back from the node connected to the goal position, 
     since the parent values from these old items are needed to find this path.
</p>
<p>For the heuristic, I made the function a result of the distance the node is from the goal position. 
    This will skew the path algorithm to choose nodes that lie closer to the goal position. 
    I tried to make the heuristic be a function of how close the nodes were to the line between start and goal, but I couldnt get it to function correctly.
